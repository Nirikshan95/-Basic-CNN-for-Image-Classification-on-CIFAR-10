# -Basic-CNN-for-Image-Classification-on-CIFAR-10
This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CNN is designed to classify 60,000 32x32 color images into 10 classes. The project includes model training, validation, and accuracy evaluation.
